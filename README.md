# Auto-Robotic-Motion-Planning
An algorithm of a robotic motion planning using Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)

# Advantages
1. This algorithm is based on based on IMPROVED DYNAMIC WINDOW APPROACH BY USING LYAPUNOV STABILITY CRITERIA H. BERTI†, A.D. SAPPA‡ and O.E. AGAMENNONI∗

2. The robot will automaticlly slow down when approaching the goal and never miss it

3. Rather than the basic DWA, this algo. can drive the robot go through the narrow crevic and change the direction over 90 degrees

5. The motion is smoothy


# What included?
1. The advanced DWA algorithm with some updates on formulas 
      
2. The simulator to run the algorithm and add obstructs as well

3. The UDP thread to connect actual robot
